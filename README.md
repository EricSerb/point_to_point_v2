# point_to_point
Algorithms project involving a point to point delivery system model


# Goals
**Add code to parse data sets and print out graphs
Experiment with Lemon
Attempt to use min cost flow algorithm

#ideas for alg
convert Dijkstra or another alg to linear program
Find some small change that we can make to Dijkstra or spanning tree alg to "improve" them
Implementing our algo or other alos in parallel
Have fun
